# Multi-Cloud Security and Compliance Framework

This project provides a modular, enterprise-aligned security framework across AWS, Azure, and GCP. It brings together technical controls, compliance mappings, operational dashboards, and business context to deliver a holistic cloud security posture.

> ðŸ”’ Built for demonstration and education. This project aligns with ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, and PCI DSS but is not a substitute for certified implementation.

---

## ðŸ”§ Project Purpose

To unify infrastructure security, data protection, monitoring, and control alignment into one deployable and explainable security control matrix â€” tailored for multi-cloud architecture.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Folder Modules

### `Additional_VM_Commands/`
- Automation commands and templates for deploying and hardening VMs
- Supports setup steps for Wazuh, audit logging, and restricted SSH access

### `Data_Masking_and_DLP_(AWS)/`
- AWS-specific masking and data loss prevention (DLP) setup
- Focuses on S3 object-level tagging, Macie, KMS usage, and access controls

### `Google_Cloud_Implementation/`
- Implementation plan and example configurations for GCP
- Mirrors key security and compliance goals from AWS with GCP-native services

### `Tables__and_Comparisons/`
- Excel/Markdown files comparing control mappings (ISO, NIST, PCI, CIS)
- Supports crosswalk between cloud-native services and security frameworks

### `Business_Requirements_Context/`
- Provides use case-to-control traceability
- Links security implementation to actual enterprise business needs and risk

### `Unified_Security_Dashboard_(using_Grafana)/`
- Grafana dashboards and pre-built visualizations
- Integrates CloudWatch, GCP logs, and custom data sources for visibility
