## Business Requirements Context

It's important to note that in real-world scenarios, the implementation of these security controls would be driven by specific business requirements and risk assessments. The technologies and configurations presented in this project represent common approaches to ISO 27001 compliance in a multi-cloud environment, but actual implementations should:

1. Be tailored to the organization's specific threat landscape
2. Consider data classification and sensitivity requirements
3. Align with business priorities and operational constraints
4. Account for existing technology investments and skill sets
5. Balance security controls with performance and cost considerations
6. Adapt to industry-specific regulatory requirements beyond ISO 27001

This project provides a technical foundation that should be customized based on proper requirements gathering and risk assessment processes.
