# Security Control Matrix Project

## Overview
Enterprise-grade security control mapping and compliance framework optimizing multi-cloud security posture and regulatory compliance.

## How the Technology Works

### 🔹 Architecture Overview
The Security Control Matrix is designed to **map security controls** across multiple cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP). It integrates **automated compliance checks, policy enforcement, and real-time monitoring** to enhance cloud security posture.

- **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**: Detects misconfigurations and security drift.
- **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**: Ensures least privilege access across cloud providers.
- **SIEM & SOAR Integration**: Aggregates security logs and automates threat responses.
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Enforces access control at all network layers.

### 🔹 Data Flow and Security Enforcement
1. **Data is collected from cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP).**
2. **Compliance checks** (ISO 27001, NIST, PCI-DSS) are mapped against security configurations.
3. **Security gaps are identified**, and alerts are generated.
4. **Automated remediation (via Terraform & Ansible)** is applied when possible.
5. **Security logs are forwarded to SIEM systems** for correlation and incident response.

### 🔹 Key Security Techniques Used
- **IAM Controls:** Enforce role-based and attribute-based access.
- **Network Security Policies:** Implement least privilege and segmentation.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** SIEM solutions detect anomalies and respond automatically.
- **Threat Intelligence:** Correlates data against known security threats.

### 🔹 Why This Approach?
| Security Model | Reason for Use |
|---------------|---------------|
| Zero Trust Architecture | Reduces attack surface by enforcing continuous authentication |
| CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) | Ensures compliance with cloud security frameworks |
| Automated Remediation (Terraform, Ansible) | Speeds up response to security misconfigurations |
| SIEM & SOAR | Improves threat detection and incident response efficiency |
